## Abstract
Urban tree plantation is essential to mitigate environmental challenges such as air pollution, stormwater runoff, and the urban heat island effect. This project identifies **optimal planting sites** within the City of Buffalo using the **Bureau of Forestry Tree Inventory dataset (133,000+ records)**. We performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **clustering (K-Means)**, **regression**, and **decision tree classification**, combined with **geospatial visualization (Folium, Heatmaps)**, to guide city planners in prioritizing zones for new plantations

## Methodology
- **Phase 1:** Data cleaning, outlier removal, EDA (DBH, eco-benefits, COâ‚‚ sequestration).
- **Phase 2:**  
  - **K-Means clustering** â†’ Identify low-benefit clusters.  
  - **Regression** â†’ Predict eco-benefits from DBH & stormwater benefits.  
  - **Decision Tree Classification** â†’ Label sites as High / Medium / Low benefit.  
  - **MapReduce** â†’ Aggregate eco-benefits by district.  
  - **Geospatial Analysis** â†’ Interactive maps of clusters, priority areas, and recommendations.  

---

##  Results
- **Clustering:** Silhouette score = 0.67, Daviesâ€“Bouldin = 0.95 (5 clusters).  
- **Regression:** RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.73, MAE = 23.18 (eco-benefits prediction).  
- **Decision Tree:** Accuracy/Precision/Recall â‰ˆ 0.91 for classification.  
- **Priority clusters:** Cluster 1 & 4 identified as low-benefit â†’ top candidates for tree planting.  
- **Recommendations:** Top 10 sites proposed, with trees needed per site to reach $1,000 yearly eco-benefits.
